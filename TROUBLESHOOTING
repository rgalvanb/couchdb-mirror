# Troubleshooting #

## Upgrade ##

Have you built CouchDB from the Subversion repository?

Did you do a svn up that seemed to break everything?

After every update you must run the following command:

    ./bootstrap -C

If you still have problems building try the next troubleshooting tip.

## First Run ##

Having problems getting CouchDB to run for the first time?

Follow this simple procedure and report back to mailing list (or IRC) with the
output of each step.

  1. Note down the name of your operating system and your processor
     architecture.

  2. Note down the installed versions of CouchDB's dependancies.

  3. Checkout a fresh version from Subversion:

        svn checkout http://couchdb.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ couchdb

  4. Bootstrap from the couchdb directory:

        ./bootstrap -C

  5. Build into a temporary directory:

        ./configure --prefix=/tmp/couchdb && make && make install

  6. Run the couchdb command and log the output:

        /tmp/couchdb/bin/couchdb

  7. Use your system's kernel trace tool and log the output of the above
     command.

    1. Linux systems should use strace:

            strace /tmp/couchdb/bin/couchdb 2> strace.out

    2. Please add documentation for your system...

  8. Report back to the mailing list (or IRC) with the output from each step.
