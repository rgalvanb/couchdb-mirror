# Development #

## Reconfiguring the Build System ##

If you have edited any of the files used by the build system, such as the
`Makefile.am` files, you will need to reconfigure your source.

To reconfigure the source run the following command from the root directory:

    autoreconf && ./confgure

## Checking In Changes ##

If your source directory has been configured or built you will need to clean
the generated files before checking into the repository by running the
following command:

    make local-clean

If everything was successful you should now have a pristine checkout.

## Preparing For Distribution ##

To build the source for distribution you should then run the following command:

    ./configure && make distcheck

If everything was successful you should see a `zip` file and/or a `tar.gz` file
sitting in the root directory ready for distribution.

## Release Checklist ##

 1. Update the `README` file with important information.
 2. Update the `NEWS` file with change information.
 3. Update the `acinclude.m4` file with version information.
